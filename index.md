<p><b>
	I am a second year Second-year PhD Student at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, supervised by Dr. Changyou Chen. In general my research interest includes:  
</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Deep generative models such as VAE and GAN</li>
  <li>Deep reinforcement learning</li>
  <li>Applications for sequence generation include text generation and action generation</li>
</ul> 




<p><b>Before that, I received master degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University at Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2016, and my bachelor degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Central SOuth University, Changsha, China.
